# Data Structures and Algorithms in C++

Welcome to the Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) repository! 
This collection contains implementations of various data structures and algorithms in C++, 
which I developed during my DSA course at the university.

## Overview

This repository aims to provide implementations of fundamental data structures and algorithms. 
Each implementation is contained in its own folder, with a header file (`.h`), source file (`.cpp`), 
and a test file (`main.cpp` or similar) where applicable.

## Implemented Data Structures

- ⬜ Linked List
- ⬜ Stack
- ⬜ Queue
- ✅ Binary Search Tree
- ✅ AVL Tree
- ⬜ 2-3 Tree
- ⬜ RB BST
- ⬜ SPLAY Tree
- ⬜ B-Tree
- ✅ Trie
- ⬜ PATRICIA tree
- ⬜ Ternary Search Trie
- ⬜ Graph
- ⬜ More coming soon...

## Implemented Algorithms

- ⬜ Sorting Algorithms
  - ⬜ Bubble Sort
  - ⬜ Merge Sort
  - ⬜ Quick Sort
- ⬜ String Sorting
  - ⬜ KMP
- ⬜ Search Algorithms
  - ⬜ Binary Search
  - ⬜ Depth-First Search (DFS)
  - ⬜ Breadth-First Search (BFS)
- ⬜ Dynamic Programming
- ⬜ Graph Algorithms
  - ⬜ Dijkstra's Algorithm
  - ⬜ Kruskal's Algorithm
- ⬜ More coming soon...

## Getting Started

To use the code in this repository, you need to have a C++ compiler (GCC) installed on your system. 

### Cloning the Repository

To get a local copy of the repository, run:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/H-Alin02/DSA-in-cpp.git
cd dsa-cpp
```
## Building and Running

Each data structure or algorithm typically includes a `main.cpp` file demonstrating its usage. You can compile and run these files using the following commands:

```bash
g++ -o output_file main.cpp
./output_file```
```
